FLATTIE PLANNING

TO CREATE FLAT:
  - Admin user creates flat data using create flat form
  - Flat data is posted to Flattie API; new row created in flat table
  -  On success, flat_id is added to Auth0 user profile using Auth0 M API

TO ADD USER TO FLAT:
  - User profile of new flattie needs to be updated with flat Id of new flat
  - Get new flattie's user id by using management API and looking up by email address
    - https://flattie.au.auth0.com/api/v2/users-by-email?email=matt%40mattchapman.io
  - If flat_id already exists on new flattie's profile. They are already a memebr of a current flat,
    so throw error saying they'll need to leave that flat first
  - Alse need to handle error if no user found for that email address
  - Eventually need to handle invite / acceptance pattern in the future
  - Otherwise add flat_id of current admin's user profile to user profile of new flattie
  - Done.
  NB: No updates need to be made to the flat table (?) as we are using the user profile to control flat owenrship


TO GET ALL FLATTIES IN FLAT:
  - Use Auth0 Management API
  - flat_id for each flattie will be stored in app_metadata property of user profile
  - Use API user search to find all users where app_metadata.flat_id = flat_id
